## Did You Know? 

Many dream of being financially stable, owning a home, and enjoying time with family. The harsh reality is that over 50% of Latinos residing in the United States do not own a home [1], and among this same population, over 50% are unbanked or underbanked [2]. The same population was less successful than other populations when answering basic financial literacy questions [3].  With premiere financial education, the Latino community can work towards this alluded dream.

_Carlos Astrada, a first-generation American, saw the predatory lending practices and lack of financial inclusion that plagued the Latino community in the United States first-hand. Despite meteoric growth in population as well as political and economic clout, the Latino community continues to be underserved.  Much more needs to be done. As a tech entrepreneur, Carlos and his team built Super Monedero with the goal to be the premiere financial education and inclusion platform for the US Latino Community._
