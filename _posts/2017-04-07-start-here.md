## Super what?

Super Monedero is a personal finance website made by Latinos and for Latinos. Our mission is helping our community to grow and improve with free and accessible content tailored to their specific needs.


## Where should I start?

We discovered that most of our visitors tend to fall in two categories: newcomers to personal finance or people trying to get their credit score back on track. That's why we prepared two "paths" that you can follow.

If you need to start your personal finance life, go [here](http://supermonedero.com/2017-04-07-the-novice-path/).

If you need to fix your credit score, go [here](http://supermonedero.com/2017-04-07-fixing-your-credit-score/).


We are always updating those paths with new articles. Subscribe to our [email list](http://eepurl.com/cylgnX) in order to receive updates.
