## Super what?

Super Monedero is a personal finance website made by Latinos for Latinos. Our mission is to help our community grow and improve with accessible free content tailored to one's specific needs.


## Where should I start?

We discovered that most of our visitors tend to fall into one of two categories: newcomers to personal finance in general or people trying to get their credit score back on track. This is why we prepared two "paths" to follow.

If you need to start learning about taking control of your personal finances, start [here](http://supermonedero.com/2017-04-07-the-novice-path/).

If you need to fix your credit score, start [here](http://supermonedero.com/2017-04-07-fixing-your-credit-score/).


We are always updating those paths with new articles. Subscribe to our [email list](http://eepurl.com/cylgnX) in order to receive updates.
