The Credit Card Act of 2009 ([Click Here](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/credit-cards/credit-card-act/) to read more about the Credit Card Act of 2009) helps lessen the potential a student can get into financial trouble by introducing measures such as requiring applicants to be at least 21 years old, having an adult co-sign, or prove their income is enough to make payments. Furthermore, if you are unable to meet the requirements and/or are not approved for a credit card - you might want to consider obtaining a secured credit card. These credit cards have some sort of collateral behind them - for example, a refundable deposit. This refundable deposit is typically equal to what your credit limit will be. The idea behind a secured credit card is that you will build up and improve your credit enough to eventually move to an unsecured card.

There are many credit cards available to students - each with their own benefits. The card that you’ll benefit the from depends on your needs. We’ve put together a list of some of the most popular credit cards out there - along with the pros and cons to help you make an informed decision on the best card for you.

It is very important when you are shopping around for credit cards that you find one that fits your needs and one you feel will not fall into a financial pitfall. 

There are many options available for college students. Some geared towards giving you great rewards and promotional offers, others are geared towards helping you rebuild or start a new credit history.
