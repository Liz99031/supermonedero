## After You Consolidate

After you figure out what option is best for you - what now? You have all the debt you want under one loan - but you might still have a few cards that have a zero balance on them.

Another reason why you should not close out your accounts is because credit scores are also determined by how long you have had an active account for. Closing out an account you had for years can actually hurt your credit score - because the history is then removed - and a factor for credit scores are history.

If the temptation is too great for you - you can always keep the credit cards open, but cut them so you can’t use them. If you feel the urge to close out the accounts. Do so over time - to spread out the negative impacts it might have on your credit score.

It is important to focus on paying down your new loan as quickly as you can and not fall into the same pitfalls that got you there in the first place. If your loan allows it - sign up for automatic payments to be made, keep a healthy amount of cash in your checking account to ensure all bills are paid on time. 

It is important to know that you are not the first person to go through this. Many people experience this in their lifetime and there are many options and resources available to you to not only get you through this, but to make sure this doesn’t have to happen again.
